### Hi, I'm Logan
I'm a computer science senior graduating from Trinity University. I currently have experience in web development and machine learning, but I'm always open to try and learn new things.

## Some projects I'm proud of
- [MDiiN](https://github.com/BioinformaticsStudy/AgingHealth): Expanded on [this](https://github.com/Spencerfar/djin-aging) age trajectory ML model to allow it to interpret more complex interactions between health variables.
- [Marlbruh](https://github.com/LoganMartinez/marlbruh): A website with a ton of functionality used by me and my roommates.
- [IMessageGPT](https://github.com/LoganMartinez/iMessage-GPT): Implements AI chatbots that can be used in IMessage chats.
